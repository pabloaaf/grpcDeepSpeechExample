the gasoline exploding something something right and you would probably kind of build as visualisation in your headthose things in your car doing those things rightsteering and i pictured the wheels turning like there's you know like they directly connected to the steering wheel you know that your mental model of how a car worksno it's not actually how a car works but it's what we perceive as how a car works oh another place where people have a lot of strong mental models are with these like electricityelectricity people think of as like this hole or you know like when the plug something into the outlet something comes out like something could come out of that outleti like it plathe outlet when nothing plugged into itnowhen you would have us believe that it's like a garden hose when you plug something in like electricity flow through the hosebut that you know you can't really see electricity we just have this kind of picture in our head and that's what's going onthe reason why we use in metaphor and mental model when we're designing inter faces or designing applications is because that's what people knowright if i ask some one too you know hierarchically describe a file system they bayou talk about right well if i said what's your mental model of your files on your computer they would probably think of like windows explorer and the little folders like a little folder tree righttheir mental model of how the files on their computer are organizedand real life what are the files on your computerthey're little aches in your hard drive right that's it they're not like there's no folders and side of your laptop hopen it up there's a little gerbil in their filing everything that's not what happens right so the mental model is what people know you know because they have lacked of understanding of the real operations they kind of build the taciturn in their head of this is how works on so when we use things like trash can people associate trash can with throwing things away so we you know yet show them a trash can to signify hey this is how you throw things away are you really throwing things away on your computer are you really throwing at email away are you walking over to a garbage can and put in that paper email and now that's not what happensnot a full hour and may we play into people mental modelswe make interface because that's what they know so we have the garbage can that throw away files we have on the magnifying glass right to look people seem magnifying glass they think that means look at it or zoo or it's going to be magnified is it really magnifying the way a magnifying glass works out you know pushing up your resolution but people seem magnifying glass and i goes women right they know what that islet's see if this guy is still aliveoh we can think of we see a lot of interface metaphors with mobile applications right because a on the computer most people who use it outer on a regular basis no something about the computer eventually but i lobata about these are users who probably don't know anything and their metaphor their mental model is still fullwhen you pick up yourself one is it like like the old wire songs where there was analogic going through the wire through the public such telephone now work is that what happens in your cell phone no what is your foe if not a super tiny computer that's all it is as a super tiny i passover tiny touch green it take your laptop i have a table computer so drinkin that's all a phone is why do we still have buttons and stuff like looking like it's a regular phone right it's not a regular phone i look computerwe make it seem like touch these buttons and you call a person just like a regular phone because that's what people know if we gave them new shone in her face alike an with that is i know how to use that phone right that's why things like soft sounds kind of fail because people are not familiar with like son on their computer they want sonoy know the

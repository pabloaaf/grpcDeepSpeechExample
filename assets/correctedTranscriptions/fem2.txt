remember is not a test if the user can do it or not, it's a test to see if the system matches what users want to do with it. Right. So we're testing how good the student life have is not how good Andy is at finding it. Right? That's what we're testing. We're not testing, Andy. We're testing the system. I see Andy with, like what the heck looks right. Issues. What the heck? Looks right. Thank you. And he is yelling at the computer now. And he Would you like some help? Does anyone know how to help Andy? Yeah, really? Ah, maybe five. That was a whole lot of assist you just gave Andy, right? So basically, if we had not help Andy, would he have been able to complete that pass? No. So our completion was, um, is grated in 0.5 or one. So zero is they cannot complete the task at all. 00.5 is they could complete the task when needed to ask for help. And one is they completed the task without asking for help. So we're going to rate that a 0.5 because And he had to ask for help And how much time did and he spend looking at that? Probably a good two minutes before I asked it it. Did he need help? Right, So too men. And then how many areas that he make? Well, technically, he made one air because he couldn't find it To start with, you would have no idea that it's under student affairs, right? He would no clue. And so that's our issues. No clue. Link is under students affairs. All right. Oh, your next task is to find a student club or organization and find out their next meeting. So find one club organization and find out their next meeting. This is also the ideal usability study because we are recording it, right? So if you were doing this for a real product, you would want to record it and then play it back to the executives. I think their system is so great so they can literally watching user fail, right? It's just kind of say found that website

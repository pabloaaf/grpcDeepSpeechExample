And president, Um, not all of us can be Steve Balmer, though. So we'll take the US jobs or the developer a test your job. So, um my because I started adding those positions into their company. Obviously, Google cares a lot about user experience. And what do you think the man salary for a user experience designer would be even know? No one has a friend who's a U X person. Kind of a fun job. Um, probably about $75,000 a year. A senior U. S. Designer makes about 100 $50,000 a year, So these jobs now are about the same salary ranges. Is development jobs quite honestly and you'll see people charging $5000.10,000 dollars for like a one weekend u X workshop for companies kind of crazy now. So this field has exploded. And like the last seven years, it's very important. It's part of the AAA vet, um curriculum accreditation. So that's why, as an undergrad, you are forced to take it. Ha ha ha. For see you. So that's why if you're not around, that's probably why you're in here. If you're a grand soon, hopefully realize that the U X job is a fun take job. And, wow, you need to know about development and a lot of us jobs. Um, require you knowing, um, a lot about, uh, application development. Um, well, so you're telling people what to do and designing how they're supposed to be doing it. So that's what we're going to work with in this class is designing what to do and telling other people how to do it. Um, of course you will have the opportunity to do it yourself if he's like So let's talk about what's the content of this course? Um, has anyone worked in design at all?

No, no, I didn't know how to write a line of code. God did not know how to do anything, What he knew how to do with the yell at people a lot and what to see. Jobs yell at people a lot for It's not good. Make it again. That's what Steve Jobs bottom line is, it's not going to go back and make it again. Make it again. Make it again. Make it again until it's good. So what you want to work on is developing an idea of what is good. This will help you when you develop your applications to make them good. And it would also help you if you wanted to go into more management. Designer director um creative job where you tell other people how to make things look good.
